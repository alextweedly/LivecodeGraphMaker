(notes on parameters, for San Jose conference, 2019-05-14)

A Graph has one or more sets of data plotted as an XY graph. There may be multiple sets
of data displayed in the Y axis - but all of those share a single X-axis.

There are therefore a number of parameters which can be optionally defined for the entire
graph; then there are other parameters which can be set for each of the datasets to be displayed.

There are two distinct Y axes - the 'normal' one plus optionally one on the right.
Each dataset will describe whether it uses the right axis or defaults to the normal one.

Graphs can have both grids and/or ticks on the axes. There are settings to allow the app
developer to specify the exact values to use for how often each of these occur, and how often
they are labelled.

However, the recommended aproach is to allow GraphMaker to adaptively choose suitabnle values.
hereby (hopefuly) ensuring that the graph remains effective over a wide range of value-ranges
that might be encountered.

There are settings that can be used to bias the adaption;
["hints"] for each axis's TickInterval, TickLabelSpacing and GridInterval, GridLabelSpacing
    settings - see below for details.

Global parameters
-----------------

XRangeIncludes - list of x values to be included
XFit - round limits to multiple of this

YRangeIncludes, YFit - same for Y
YRightRangeIncludes, YRightFit - same for Y on right

Title - a title (displayed at the top of the graph)
XAxisTitle, YAxisTitle, YRAxisTitle - titles to be displayed by each axis

XGridInterval - gap (in data units) between vertical grid lines (i.e. for X valuea)
     set to 0 (default) for no grid
XTickInterval - same as XGridInterval, but for ticks.
     0 = no axis at all, empty = (default) axis but no tick
     >0 = ticks at multiples of interval (0, 2, 4, ...)
     <0 ticks at interval FROM xmin  (maybe 1, 3, 5, ...)

XTickLabelSpacing : 'N' = put label at each N'th tick ... (0 for none)
YTickLabelSpacing : 'N' = put label at each N'th tick ... (0 for none)

backgroundcolor - color for background of the whole graph

YGridInterval,  YTickInterval - as X
YRGridInterval,  YRTickInterval - as X for right side

DataIncludesX - if TRUE, then each line of each dataset contains an X value
              - otherwise, no X values are present in the datasets,
                 and this element contains (up to) two values : initial and step X values
                 default (i.e. empty) is for inital value of 0, and step value 1
           NB - applies to ALL datasets

itemDel, lineDel : replacing comma/CR for convenience

hints - contains for each axis, hnts to determine the interval and labelsspacing values for both
        Ticks and Grids.  This sets the initial, minimum, maximum and step-multiplier to use in
        the calculations.
        NB these are all in source data values, not pixels.


Then there are the datasets.

Data - one or more datasets, numerically indexed, in bottom-to-top drawing order.
     (e.g. tA["data"][1])

Dataset Parameters
------------------

name - the name of this dataset (not actually used for anything yet)

graphtype  one of bar, line, step, Xticklabels, Yticklabels, Xgridlabels, Ygridlabels
             for "line", it can be followed by additional optional words :
                  - filled   - fill in below this line, with fillcolor
                  - invisibe (i.e. no line segments, but still draw markers)
             for "step", it can be followed by additional optional words :
                  - verticalFirst (default) or horizontalFirst
                     describe whether to go up/down then along, or along then up/down
  Note that bar, step and line graphs can be "stacked" - i.e. there can be multiple Y values
   producing "stacked" graphs.

  Likely future additional graphtype - bubble charts.

color  : colour value, one per line for stacked charts
lineSize  : size (width) of the line to be drawn, one per line for stacked charts
fillcolor : color for the filled in polygon, one per line for stacked charts
fillblend : blend level for the filled polygon, one per line for stacked charts

values - list of values for the dataset
          - so either Y, or if DataIncludesX then X,Y
          -        or Y,Y,Y,Y... or if DataIncludesX then X,Y,Y,Y,...   - producing 'stacked' lines
                   NB these all share other values, but can have different colors
          - or,  if graphtype=Xlabels then it is  'label' or if DataIncludesX then X,Label

blend - blend level for drawing
dropshadow - put in a dropshadow

YRaxis : use the Right axis for scaling, etc.

marker : name of marker shape to use  (diamond, square, ???)
markersize : size of marker
markercolor : color for marker

barDensity :  specifies the percentage of the ratio between bar and gap
                    (e.g. 50 would say that each bar is the same size as the gap,
                    75 would say the bar takes 3/4 of the unit width, while the gap takes the rest, etc.)_
                    Default is 75


X Value spacing

For a graph consistng only of line charts, the calculation of X_value spacing is straightforward. We calculate the spread of X data values (i.e. min to max values, plus anything specified in an 'XIncludes', and then rounded out to include anything needed for an 'XFit'). Let's call this the "virtual data range". This range of values is then scaled to cover the visual space from the Y-axis to the right-Y-axis.

However, for a bar-chart, we need to allow the space for a 1/2 gap width plus a 1/2 bar width on each side of these (virtual) data values. Also, we need to allow a way to specify the 'density' of the display - i.e. how wide the bars are, and how wide the gaps between them are. And, especially in the case of DataIncludesX

Xunit - X_unit   (NB shared for all datasets in the whole graph)
        X_unit specifies the unit size (i.e. in 'source data' terms)

        The default is for the X_unit to be 1 (as it will be unless DataIncludesX is TRUE), while the default for barDensity is 75.
